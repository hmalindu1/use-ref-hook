The Home component is the main component of our application. 
It renders a container div with a flex layout that takes up the full screen height.
It has a title h1 and a div that contains the EmojiRow and MeaningList components.

The meaningRefs object is created to store refs to the meaning divs in MeaningList component.
Each property in the object represents a meaning and its value is a ref created with the useRef hook.
These refs will be used in the EmojiRow component to scroll to the corresponding meaning when a tile is clicked.

The Home component returns a JSX div that contains the title, EmojiRow, and MeaningList components.
